## Gravity Simulator

<b> Gravitation: </b>The law of gravitation states that the force of attraction between any two objects is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The law applies to objects anywhere in the universe.

<b> Working of [application](https://github.com/ajay-deshmukh/gravity-simulator/blob/master/application.py) </b>

<i> It's identify the force of gravity when travels upward with acceleration <b>a</b> and velocity <b>v</b> at specific distance <b>d</b> between below singular objects and acceleration due to gravity <b>g</b> of the earth </i>
